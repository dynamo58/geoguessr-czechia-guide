\begin{abstract}
Czechia or the Czech republic is a country notoriously difficult. For one thing it is very difficult to region-guess and at times also to distinguish from some of the surrounding countries. This document tries to outline all of the possible metas and actual geography knowledge there is to be obtain in order to guess this country accuretly and be able to make informed region-guesses within the country itself.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{About the author}

My name is Marek Smolík and I am a fellow Geoguessr player. I have lived in Czechia my whole life and played Czechia extensively on Geoguessr, speedrunning it among other gamemodes. As such I have accumulated knowledge that is not necessarily well-known. I have no intention in trying to gatekeep this information... the complete opposite... actually.
